# CS598_Final_Project

## Environment Setup

This project uses the `torch_framework` conda environment. You can set up the environment using one of the following methods:

### Method 1: Using Conda (Recommended)

Create the complete environment using the conda environment file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate torch_framework

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
